### 5.1.1 Definition

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vx3XB5mz7UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- A sequence is an infinitely long list of real numbers. For example,
  the sequence of positive even integers is \\(\\<2,4,6,8,\dots\\>\\).
- **Example**
  Use your intuition to guess the next three terms of the sequences
  \\(\\<1,3,5,7,9,\dots\\>\\),
  \\(\\<3,-6,9,-12,15,\dots\\>\\), and
  \\(\\<0,1,4,9,16,\dots\\>\\).
- An explicit formula \\(a_n\\) is a rule defining each term of the
  sequence, where \\(n=0\\) yields the first term, \\(n=1\\) gives the
  next term, and so on. The sequence generated by the formula \\(a_n\\)
  is written as
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty=\\<a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots\\>\\).
    - Occasionally the first term of the sequence
      may be given by an integer different from \\(0\\), in which case
      the sequence is written like
      \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\).
- **Example**
  Write the first five terms of the sequences
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\),
  \\(\\<b_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\), and
  \\(\\<c_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\)
  defined by
  \\(a_n=4n\\),
  \\(b_n=\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2+2}\\), and
  \\(c_n=\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}n)\\).
- **Example** Give the term \\(a_7\\) for the sequence defined by
  the formula \\(a_n=\frac{n}{2n+1}\\).
  <!-- TODO replace previous with create a formula question -->


### 5.1.2 Recursive Formulas

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxtFf3g1DNI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- A recursive formula for a sequence defines one or more initial terms of
  the sequence, and then defines future terms of the sequence by using
  previous terms.
- **Example** Write the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence defined
  by the recursive formula \\(f_0=1,f_1=1,f_{n+2}=f_n+f_{n+1}\\).
- **Example** Write the first six terms of the factorial sequence defined
  by the recursive formula \\(!\_0=1,!\_{n+1}=(n+1)!\_n\\).
- The factorial sequence is commonly written in the form \\(n!\\) rather
  than \\(!\_n\\). It has the explicit formula
  \\(n!=1\times2\times3\times\dots\times n\\).
- **Example** Prove that \\(a_n=\frac{3}{2^n}\\)
  is an explicit formula for the
  sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\) defined recursively by
  \\(a_0=3,a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n}{2}\\).

### 5.1.3 Limits, Convergence, and Divergence

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Zqwo5dZAaU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=i}^\infty\\) converges to a limit
  \\(L\\) if for each \\(\epsilon>0\\), there exists an integer \\(N\\)
  such that \\(\|a_n-L\|<\epsilon\\) for all \\(n\geq N\\).
  This is written as \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\\) or
  \\(a_n\to L\\).
- **Example** Guess the limit of the harmonic sequence    
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\) defined by \\(a_n=\frac{1}{n}\\)
  by writing out the first few terms.
- **Example** Guess the limit of the sequence    
  defined by \\(g_n=\frac{2^n}{2^{n+1}}\\)
  by writing out the first few terms.
- A sequence diverges when it doesn't converge to any limit.
- **Example** Write a few terms of the sequence defined by the formula
  \\(b_n=(-1)^n\frac{n+1}{n+2}\\). Does it appear to be converging or
  diverging?

## 5.2 Computing Limits of Sequences

- University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)
    - 9.1

### 5.2.1 Limits of Sequences and Functions

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEqbxJeq9_M" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- If \\(f(x)\\) is a function and \\(a_n\\) is a sequence such that
  \\(f(n)=a_n\\) for sufficiently large integers \\(n\\), then
  \\(\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)=L\\) implies \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\\).
- Therefore all the rules for evaluating \\(\lim_{x\to\infty}f(x)\\)
  extend to evaluating \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n\\).
- **Example** Use factoring to compute
  \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{4+n}{n^3+1}\\).
- **Example** Use L'Hopital's Rule to prove that any sequence
  defined by the formula \\(a_n=\frac{n^2+3}{4-5n^2}\\) converges to
  \\(-\frac{1}{5}\\).
- **Example** Use the squeeze theorem to compute
  \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\sin n}{n}\\).

### 5.2.2 Common Limits

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/--o02u0BdUo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The following limits are often useful:
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} x = x\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} = 0\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{\ln n}{n} = 0\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{n} = 1\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \sqrt[n]{x} = 1\\), \\(x>0\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} x^n = 0\\), \\(\|x\|<1\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} (1+\frac{x}{n})^n=e^x\\)
    - \\(\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!}=0\\)
- **Example** Find \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\ln(n^3)}{n}\\).
- **Example** Find \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{3^n+1}{n!}\\).
- **Example** Find \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}(4n)^{1/n}\\).

### 5.2.3 Monotonic and Bounded Sequences

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVx-4y-N-P0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- A sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=i}^\infty\\) is bounded if there exist
  real numbers \\(A,B\\) such that \\(A\leq a_n\leq B\\) for all integers
  \\(n\geq i\\).
- **Example** Is the sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\)
  where \\(a_n=\frac{n+1}{n}\\) bounded?
- **Example** Is the sequence \\(\\<b_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\)
  given by \\(b_n=\frac{n}{(-3)^n}\\) bounded?
- A sequence is monotonic if it either never increases or never decreases.
- **Example** Is the sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\)
  where \\(a_n=\frac{n+1}{n}\\) monotonic?
- **Example** Is the sequence \\(\\<b_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\)
  given by \\(b_n=\frac{n}{(-3)^n}\\) monotonic?
- The Monotonic Sequence Theorem states that
  all bounded monotonic sequences converge.

## 5.3 Series

- University Calculus: Early Transcendentals (3rd Ed)
    - 9.2

### 5.3.1 Series as Partial Sum Sequences

- For a given sequence \\(\\<a_i\\>\_{i=0}^\infty\\), its
  partial sum sequence \\(\\<s_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\) is defined explicitly
  by \\(s_n=\sum_{i=0}^n a_i=a_0+a_1+\dots+a_n\\), and defined recursively by
  \\(s_0=a_0\\) and \\(s_{n+1}=s_n+a_{n+1}\\).
- **Example** Write out the first few terms of the partial sum sequence for
  \\(\\<1,2,3,4,5,\dots\\>\\).
- **Example** Write out the first few terms of the partial sum sequence for
  \\(\\<b_i\\>\_{i=1}^\infty\\) where \\(b_i=\frac{6}{i}\\).
- The series \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n=a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots\\) represents the
  sum of the infinite sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\). If its
  partial sum sequence converges to \\(L\\), then we say that its series
  converges to \\(L\\) and the value of the series is \\(L\\)
  (written \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n=a_0+a_1+a_2+\dots=L\\)). Otherwise,
  we say the series diverges.

### 5.3.2 Telescoping/Geometric Sequences and Series

- A telescoping series is a series whose partial sum sequence allows for
  canceling.
- **Example** Show that \\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty(\frac{1}{n}-\frac{1}{n+1})\\)
  converges to \\(1\\) by evaluating the limit of its partial sum sequence.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{2}{n^2+3n+2}\\) converge or
  diverge?
- The geometric series defined for real numbers \\(a,r\\) is
  \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n=a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+\dots\\).
- The geometric series \\(\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n\\) converges to
  \\(\frac{a}{1-r}\\) when \\(|r|<1\\), and diverges when \\(|r|\geq 1\\).
- **Example** Compute \\(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{8}+\dots\\).
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2}{3^{n+1}}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2}{(1/3)^{n+1}}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?

### 5.3.3 Divergent Series

- The Series Divergence Test: If a sequence diverges, then its series diverges.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{k^2+3}{2k^2+k+5}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
- This does NOT mean that if a sequence converges, then its series converges.
- The harmonic sequence \\(\\<\frac{1}{n}\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\) converges to
  \\(0\\), but its series \\(\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}\\) diverges.

### 5.3.4 Arithmetic Rules and Reindexing

- Because a series is a limit, it follows the same rules as limits do.
- **Example** Evaluate the convergent series
  \\(\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1+\frac{2^{n+2}}{n+1}-\frac{2^{n+2}}{n+2}}{2^n}\\).
- The starting index for a series may be adjusted by offsetting the index for
  its sequence in the opposite direction.
- **Example** Does \\(\sum_{k=-1}^\infty\frac{1}{n+2}\\) converge or
  diverge? If it converges, what is its value?
