### 5.1.1 Definition

- A sequence is an infinitely long list of real numbers. For example,
  the sequence of positive even integers is \\(\\<2,4,6,8,\dots\\>\\).
- **Example**
  Use your intuition to guess the next three terms of the sequences
  \\(\\<1,3,5,7,9,\dots\\>\\),
  \\(\\<3,-6,9,-12,15,\dots\\>\\), and
  \\(\\<0,1,4,9,16,\dots\\>\\).
- An explicit formula \\(a_n\\) is a rule defining each term of the
  sequence, where \\(n=0\\) yields the first term, \\(n=1\\) gives the
  next term, and so on. The sequence generated by the formula \\(a_n\\)
  is written as
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty=\\<a_0,a_1,a_2,\dots\\>\\).
    - Occasionally the first term of the sequence
      may be given by an integer different from \\(0\\), in which case
      the sequence is written like
      \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\).
- **Example**
  Write the first five terms of the sequences
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\),
  \\(\\<b_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\), and
  \\(\\<c_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\)
  defined by
  \\(a_n=4n\\),
  \\(b_n=\frac{(-1)^n}{n^2+2}\\), and
  \\(c_n=\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}n)\\).
- **Example** Give the term \\(a_7\\) for the sequence defined by
  the formula \\(a_n=\frac{n}{2n+1}\\).
  <!-- TODO replace previous with create a formula question -->


### 5.1.2 Recursive Formulas

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxtFf3g1DNI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- A recursive formula for a sequence defines one or more initial terms of
  the sequence, and then defines future terms of the sequence by using
  previous terms.
- **Example** Write the first ten terms of the Fibonacci sequence defined
  by the recursive formula \\(f_0=1,f_1=1,f_{n+2}=f_n+f_{n+1}\\).
- **Example** Write the first six terms of the factorial sequence defined
  by the recursive formula \\(!\_0=1,!\_{n+1}=(n+1)!\_n\\).
  (Note: This sequence is commonly written in the form \\(n!\\) rather
  than \\(!\_n\\).)
- **Example** Prove that \\(a_n=\frac{3}{2^n}\\)
  is an explicit formula for the
  sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=0}^\infty\\) defined recursively by
  \\(a_0=3,a_{n+1}=\frac{a_n}{2}\\).

### 5.1.3 Limits, Convergence, and Divergence

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Zqwo5dZAaU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The sequence \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=i}^\infty\\) converges to a limit
  \\(L\\) if for each \\(\epsilon>0\\), there exists an integer \\(N\\)
  such that \\(\|a_n-L\|<\epsilon\\) for all \\(n\geq N\\).
  This is written as \\(\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n=L\\).
- **Example** Guess the limit of the harmonic sequence    
  \\(\\<a_n\\>\_{n=1}^\infty\\) defined by \\(a_n=\frac{1}{n}\\)
  by writing out the first few terms.
- **Example** Guess the limit of the sequence    
  defined by \\(g_n=\frac{2^n}{2^{n+1}}\\)
  by writing out the first few terms.
- A sequence diverges when it doesn't converge to any limit.
- **Example** Write a few terms of the sequence defined by the formula
  \\(b_n=(-1)^n\frac{n+1}{n+2}\\). Does it appear to be converging or
  diverging?
