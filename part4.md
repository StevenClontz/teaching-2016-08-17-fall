### 4.1.1 Parametric Equations

- If \\(x(t),y(t)\\) are both defined as functions of \\(t\\) over some
  interval \\(I\\) of real numbers, then the set of points
  \\(\\{(x(t),y(t)):t\in I\\}\\) is the parametric curve with a
  system of parametric equations \\(x(t),y(t)\\). If \\(I\\) is omitted,
  then it is assumed that \\(t\\) belongs to the set of all real numbers.
- **Example**
  Plot the parametric curve \\(x=\cos t,y=\sin t\\) for
  \\(0\leq t\leq 2\pi\\), first by using a chart of \\(t,x,y\\) values,
  then by expressing the curve as an equation of \\(x,y\\).
- **Example**
  Show that the systems of parametric equations \\(x_0=t,y_0=t^2\\) and
  \\(x_1=2t-2,y_1=4t^2-8t+4\\) share the same parametric curve.

### 4.1.2 Parametrizing Curves Defined by Functions

- The curve \\(y=f(x)\\) where \\(x\\) belongs to the interval \\(I\\)
  may be easily parametrized left-to-right
  by the system of parametric equations
  \\(x=t,y=f(t)\\) where \\(t\\) also belongs to \\(I\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the curve \\(y=\ln x\\)
  from \\((1,0)\\) to \\((e^2,2)\\).

### 4.1.3 Parametrizing Line Segments

- The line segment joining the points \\((x_0,y_0),(x_1,y_1)\\) may
  be parametrized by \\(x=x_0+(x_1-x_0)t,y=y_0+(y_1-y_0)t\\) where
  \\(0\leq t\leq 1\\).
- **Example**
  Give a system of parametric equations for the line segment joining
  \\((2,-3)\\) and \\((-1,4)\\).
- **Example**
  Give two different systems of parametric equations for the portion of the
  line \\(y=3x-2\\) between \\(x=-1\\) and \\(x=2\\).
- The full line may be obtained with the same equations
  by allowing \\(t\\) to range over all real numbers.

### Exercises for 4.1

1.  Plot the parametric curve \\(x=2-t^2,y=2t^2\\) for
    \\(0\leq t\leq 3\\), first by using a chart of \\(t,x,y\\) values,
    then by expressing the curve as an equation of \\(x,y\\).
2.  Plot the parametric curve \\(x=3^t,y=3^{-t}\\) for
    \\(-\infty<t<\infty\\), first by using a chart of \\(t,x,y\\) values,
    then by expressing the curve as an equation of \\(x,y\\).
3.  Show that the systems of parametric equations \\(x_0=t+2,y_0=e^2e^t\\) and
    \\(x_1=\ln t,y_1=t\\) share the same parametric curve.
    Then plot that curve.
4.  Give a system of parametric equations for the curve \\(y=\cosh x\\)
    from \\((-\ln 2,5/4)\\) to \\((\ln 2,5/4)\\).
5.  Give a system of parametric equations for the line segment joining
    \\((0,-4)\\) and \\((3,5)\\).
6.  Give a system of parametric equations for the line segment joining
    \\((1,2)\\) and \\((-3,3)\\).
7.  Give two different systems of parametric equations for the portion of the
    line \\(y=4-3x\\) between \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=3\\).
8.  (Optional)
    Let \\(a<b\\).
    Find a system of parametric equations which parametrizes the planar
    curve \\(y=f(x)\\) *right-to-left* from \\(x=b\\) to \\(x=a\\).
