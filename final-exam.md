Here are some details on your final exam:

- **Length of exam:**
  The midterm was written to take about 35 minutes for
  a prepared student to finish, and students were given 55 minutes to complete
  it. The final exam will be written to take a prepared student
  about 60 minutes to finish, and students will be given 120 minutes to
  complete it. No questions will be skippable on the final, but there
  will be a few bonus points available.
  (Promising a certain number of questions isn't helpful
  since different questions take different amounts of time.)
- **Material from Parts 1-3:** About 30% to 50% of the final will consist
  of problems from Parts 1-3 of the class website. These problems will be
  solely based on the questions asked on the midterm, so you should only
  study problems like those.
- **Material from Parts 4-6:** The rest of the final will consist of problems
  from Parts 4-6 of the class website. The following topics are guaranteed
  to appear, but students are responsible for *all* material covered in Parts
  4-6 (so, there will be questions not listed below as well):
    - Arclength (either section 4.2 or 4.4)
    - Rigorously computing a sequence limit (section 5.2)
    - Evaluating the value of a geometric or telescoping series (section 5.3)
    - Showing convergence/divergence with one of the Comparison Tests
      (section 5.5)
    - Finding the domain of a power series (section 6.1)
    - Generating a Maclaurin or Taylor series (section 6.2)
    - Approximating the value of a function with
      a Taylor polynomial (section 6.3)
