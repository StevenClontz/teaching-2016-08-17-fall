- Recall that \\(\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\\) is the net area between \\(y=f(x)\\)
  and \\(y=0\\).
- Let \\(f(x)\leq g(x)\\) for \\(a\leq x\leq b\\). We define the area
  between the curves \\(y=f(x)\\) and \\(y=g(x)\\) from \\(a\\) to \\(b\\)
  to be the integral \\(\int_a^b [g(x)-f(x)]\,dx\\).
- We call \\(y=f(x)\\) the bottom curve and \\(y=g(x)\\) the top curve.
- **Example** Find the area between the curves \\(y=2+x\\) and
  \\(y=1-\frac{1}{2}x\\) from \\(2\\) to \\(4\\).

- **Example** Find the area bounded by the curves \\(y=x^2-4\\) and
  \\(y=8-2x^2\\).
- **Example** Prove that the area of a circle of radius \\(r\\) is
  \\(\pi r^2\\). (Hint: use the curves \\(y=\pm\sqrt{r^2-x^2}\\).)

### 3.1.2 Areas between Functions of \\(y\\)

- Areas between functions \\(f(y)\leq g(y)\\) may be found similarly,
  but in this case \\(x=f(y)\\) is the left curve and \\(x=g(y)\\) is
  the right curve.
- **Example** Find the area bounded by the curves \\(y=\sqrt{x}\\),
  \\(y=0\\), and \\(y=x-2\\).

### 3.2.1 Defining Volume with Integrals

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/myniFisw1sY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- The volume of a solid defined between \\(x=a\\) to \\(x=b\\)
  with a cross-sectional area of \\(A(x)\\) at each \\(x\\)-value
  is defined to be \\(V=\int_a^b A(x)\,dx\\).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XuRYovkZE-s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

- Steps for solving such problems:
    1. Sketch the solid along the \\(x\\)-axis with a typical
       cross-section at some \\(x\\) value.
    2. Find the formula for \\(A(x)\\), and the minimal/maximal
       \\(x\\) values \\(a,b\\).
    3. Evaluate \\(V=\int_a^b A(x)\,dx\\).
- **Example** Show that the volume of a pyramid with a square base
  of sidelength \\(2\\) and height \\(3\\) is \\(4\\) cubic units.

### 3.2.2 Circular Cross-Sections

- In the case that all cross-sections are circular, we may replace
  \\(A(x)\\) with \\(\pi[R(x)]^2\\), where \\(R(x)\\) is the radius
  of the circular cross-section at that \\(x\\) value.
- **Example** Prove that a cone of radius \\(r\\) and height \\(h\\)
  has volume \\(V=\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2 h\\).
