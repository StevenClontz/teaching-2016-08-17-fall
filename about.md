## Course Description

Upon the successful completion of the course a student will be able to:

* Define, compute, and interpret a definite integral.
* State, explain, and apply the fundamental theorem of calculus.
* Perform techniques of integration, including u-substitution, integration by
  parts, decomposition into partial fractions, and trigonometric substitution.
* Recognize and compute improper integrals.
* Apply integrals to concepts such as area, volume, arc length, mass, work,
  and energy.
* Manipulate infinite sequences and series.
* Apply tests of convergence and divergence.
* Find the interval of convergence for power series, manipulate power series
  within their intervals of convergence, and represent analytic functions as a
  Taylor series.
* Describe plane curves in terms of parametric equations and polar
  coordinates.

This course will adopt a *"flipped classroom"* model. Students are expected
to watch online lectures covering course material on their own time. Students
will then be given assignments to complete in groups during the scheduled
course times, with the assistance of the instructor. Put another way, you
watch the lectures at home, and then do your "homework" during class when you
can ask me questions.
