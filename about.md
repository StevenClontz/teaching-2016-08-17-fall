## Course Description

This course expands upon the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals
introduced in Calculus 1. In addition to developing advanced techniques
for computing and applying integrals, the ultimate goal of the course is
to introduce the *power series*, an "infinite polynomial" which can be used
to express a wide class of differentiable functions.

This course will adopt a *"flipped classroom"* model. Students are expected
to watch online lectures covering course material on their own time. Students
will then be given assignments to complete in groups during the scheduled
course times, with the assistance of the instructor. Put another way, you
watch the lectures at home, and then do your "homework" during class.

## Grading

Each student's grade is computed as a sum of the following categories:

- Participation: 150 points
- Quizzes: 150 points
- Midterm: 300 points
- Final: 400 points
- **Total: 1000 points**

Letter grades are assigned as follows:

- A: 900 or more points
- B: between 800 and 899 points
- C: between 700 and 799 points
- D: between 650 and 699 points
- F: 649 or less points
- F: less than 50 Participation points (overrules above assignments)
- F*: stop attending class before end of semester
  (assigned by university, overrules above assignments)

## Participation

Students are expected to watch online lectures from their personal
computers or mobile devices. These lectures will be announced as
a news post on the class website on a week-by-week basis.

Class periods typically consist of the instructor displaying several
problems on the board based upon the lecture announced on the class
website for that day. Students will work in groups on these problems,
and are encouraged to ask the instructor questions on the material.

Each class period, students satisfying ALL of the following criteria
will earn 3 Participation points.

- Was present at the beginning of class
- Previously watched the appropriate lecture video(s)
- Engaged in the material
- Worked well with other students

There are more than 50 class periods this semester, so full credit for
Participation (150 points) is possible without 100% attendance.
However, students may not count more than 150 Participation points toward
their overall grade.

Note that students earning less than 50 Participation points
(1/3 of the maximum) will automatically receive a failing grade of F*.

## Quizzes

At the end of many class periods, the instructor will pose an exit
quiz on the board, usually one or two questions. A multiple-choice sheet
will be provided by the instructor for recording responses.

Each correct/complete response is worth 4 Quiz points. Like Participation,
more than 150 Quiz points will be available throughout the semester,
but 150 is the maximum allowed to count toward a student's overall grade.

## Midterm and Final Exam

The Midterm and Final Exam will be structured similarly, except that
the Midterm is 50 minutes, and the Final Exam is 120 minutes.

Each exam is based upon the problems covered during class prior
to it. Full responses are required, and partial credit will be assigned.

There will also be a 50 minute Practice Test of a similar format,
worth 20 Quiz points.

### Preparing for Exams

This website is your study guide for all exams. At least 80% of the
credit for each exam will be based directly upon either **Example** questions
from the online lectures, or **Review Exercises** solved during class
periods (including Quiz questions). *Other questions may also
be asked to assess general understanding of the
material and the ability to apply it to new problems.*

Each exam covers the following material:

- **Practice Test**: Part 1 and Sections 2.1 to 2.3
- **Midterm**: Parts 1 to 3
- **Final Exam**: All Sections, focusing mainly on
    - questions covered on the Midterm from Parts 1 to 3, and
    - all topics from Parts 4 to 6
    - Study Guide: [[link]](final/)

### Using notes during exams

Each student may bring **notes in their own handwriting** to use
during each exam, with the following limits:

- **Practice Test**: two 8.5x11in pages, front-and-back
- **Midterm**: three 8.5x11in pages, front-and-back
- **Final Exam**: five 8.5x11in pages, front-and-back
    - These notes must be turned in with the final exam.

## Absences and Makeup Policy

Students should retain documentation of excusable absences throughout the
semester in case Participation is affected. During the final week of
the course, the instructor will
review these documents at the request of a student who wishes to have
their Participation grade altered due to excused absences.

The Midterm and Final Exam may only be made up if documentation
of the absence is received and accepted by the instructor within three
days following the end of the excused period of absence. The exam must
be made up within a week following the acceptance of the excuse, as
scheduled by the student and instructor.

Only the following may be accepted by the instructor as proof of an
excused absence.

- Documentation from a medical professional that the student was
  unable to attend class.
- Written confirmation from the instructor that the absence is excused.
  Generally, planned absences such as university-related events will
  only be excused by the instructor if given at least one week's
  advance notice, and other documentation may be required.

## Accommodations

If you have a specific disability that qualifies you for academic
accommodations, please notify the instructor and provide
certification from
[Student Disability Services](http://www.southalabama.edu/departments/sds/index.html).
SDS is located at 320 Alumni
Circle, Educational Services Building, Suite 19 (460-7212).

## Academic Honesty

This course is subject to South Alabama's
*Student Academic Conduct Policy*. Any violations of academic honesty
will be reported to The Office of the Senior Vice President for
Academic Affairs.

## USAonline

Grades will be confidentially posted via USAonline.

## Calculators and Electronics

Problems on exams will not require the use of a calculator; however,
the instructor will provide simple four-function calculators to
assist with arithmetic. No other electronics are allowed during exams.
Otherwise, electronics are allowed to be used
during class, provided they do not disrupt others or otherwise negatively
affect participation.

## Student/Instructor Interactions

The instructor and all students are expected to treat others respectfully.
As the instructor should be addressed as "Dr. Clontz" or "Prof. Clontz",
the instructor will generally address each student as "Mr. Lastname",
"Ms. Lastname", or simply his or her last name. Students are encouraged
to contact the instructor if they have a preference on how they are
addressed.

## Contingency Plan

If normal course activities are disrupted due to unanticipated
circumstances, this syllabus and other course plans and assignments may be
modified. If this occurs, an addendum to this
syllabus and/or course assignments will be provided by the instructor.
