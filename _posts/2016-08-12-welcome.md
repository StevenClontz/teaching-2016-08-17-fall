Hello world! This is the course webpage for Prof. Clontz's
MA126 course, Calculus 2, for Fall 2016 at The University
of South Alabama.

New students should begin by reading the
[syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}about/). I recommend you bookmark
the class [homepage]({{site.baseurl}}) as updates will be
announced primarily via this site (although major updates will
also be announced by email as well).

Contact me at <sclontz@southalabama.edu> with any questions!
